This article is a proof of concept. I find myself often in these brainstorming sessions, and I would like to document the process.

While documenting the brainstorm session I am revisiting the ideas while putting them to words. This also allows me to close tabs, and create free space.

This is an entirely selfish endeavor. I simply want to document my process of going from Point A to Point B whilst putting something into action. 

## How did I get here?

### Blog Article Microsoft FX - Low Code Tools

{{< link-preview "https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-power-fx-the-low-code-programming-language-for-everyone/" >}}

Just announced four days ago. I am reading this article and wondering how Microsoft FX was built. I can see the potential. 

> Low code logic for everyone...From citizens to professionals

I honestly feel this whole space is going to be huge. Training teams, change management, unlocking employee potential - it all feels disruptive and liberating.

I feel Microsoft is really onto something.

I don't get the sense of *what* this can build or *how* the workflow looks.

### YouTube Rory Neary - What is Microsoft Fx?

{{< link-preview "https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-power-fx-the-low-code-programming-language-for-everyone/" >}}

Onto to video learning! I only made it to 2:52 - I remember feeling like I wasn't quite getting the information I want.

Reflecting on this now I do see that he goes into more details later in the video. I intend to circle back and rewatch.

### Blog Article TechRepublic - Microsoft's new Power Fx is an open-source language based on Excel

OK, Microsoft Fx is based on Excel formulas - I get that.

> Power Fx is described by Microsoft as a general-purpose, strong-typed, declarative, and functional programming language

I am very interested in being able to use some functional programming tools in a very high-level way. I still want to know what is the buy-in? 

Also, I don't understand Power Apps that well.

### Docs Mirosoft Power Apps - What are canvas apps in Power Apps?

{{< link-preview "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started" >}}

All *sounds* good.

> Design and build a business app from a canvas in Microsoft Power Apps without writing code in a traditional programming language such as C#

> Can automatically generate a model-driven app from your business data and processes

The Microsoft ecosystem is huge, this is part of the appeal. I feel Microsoft is positioning itself as the goto *get real work done* brand. 

Reminds me of the impact that Microsoft Teams is having right now. 

OK well, how do I get started?

### Website Microsoft PowerApps - Why Power Apps and Microsoft Azure are better together

{{< link-preview "https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps-and-azure/" >}}

More buzz words and great-sounding solutions. I just want to understand what it feels like to build something. 

### Docs Microsoft PowerApps - Introducing Power Apps

{{< link-preview "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-powerapps/1-powerapps-introduction" >}}

The Microsoft documentation is extensive. It is all well explained, but at this point feels verbose.

I scroll down and finally see these links:

+ [Make a Power App](https://make.powerapps.com/)
+ [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com/studio/)
+ [Power Apps admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/)

I click around for a bit - but generally feel a little frustrated. 

There is information I want but I am not getting...

How does it *feel* to use these tools? What are the limits? Best use cases? Learning curve? What is the quality of the output? Can I see some performance tests of an app built with Microsoft FX vs C# vs NodeJS?

Also, I don't understand what SharePoint is.

### Google Search - What is SharePoint?

{{< link-preview "https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+sharpointn&oq=what+is+sharpointn&aqs=chrome..69i57.2826j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" >}}


> Organizations use Microsoft SharePoint to create websites. You can use it as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information from any device.

OK, so SharePoint builds websites?

Also, I know what I am missing here. I want to see a video in the rich text snippet. Not just any video - I want to see a highlight reel, like a trailer.

I want to get the greatest sense of this new idea or technology in the least amount of time. This is how I feel generally.

Thinking about my own business - building Jamstack websites. I want to have a video show up in my Google search results. I want to make a trailer! I bet that would be cool.

### Website Backlinko - Rich Snippets

{{< link-preview "https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/snippets" >}}

I know the general stuff. What I want to see is the specifics of creating video snippets.

### Docs Google Developers - Get videos on Google with schema markup

{{< link-preview "https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/video" >}}

OK, thanks Google. This is exactly what I needed. I will be back.

### Support Microsfot - What is SharePoint?

{{< link-preview "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-sharepoint-97b915e6-651b-43b2-827d-fb25777f446f" >}}

> Organizations use Microsoft SharePoint to create websites

Yes, thanks. I know this is powerful because of the Microsoft ecosystem.

I want to see one of these sites. What does it look like? What is the Google PageSpeed score?

### Website Kuwaitairways 

{{< link-preview "https://www.kuwaitairways.com/en" >}}

I don't remember how I found this. There was a list of Sharepoint websites somewhere.

The page felt like it took forever to load, tons of layout shift. The design is clean, but they still use a slider. Animations need easing. Whatever.

Front and center you can see the *book a flight* functionality. OK, this is the heart of the application. The business logic is here, I assume it works.

### Website Google Developers - PageSpeed Insights

{{< link-preview "https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuwaitairways.com%2F" >}}

Website does not load. 

> Lighthouse returned error: FAILED_DOCUMENT_REQUEST. Lighthouse was unable to reliably load the page you requested. Make sure you are testing the correct URL and that the server is properly responding to all requests. (Details: net::ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED)Dismiss

What I am thinking here is a way to build websites with my Jamstack, create a backend with the Microsoft ecosystem and allow for some Notion-like content editing for users.

### Website Google Search - Notion for Microsoft Power Apps

{{< link-preview "https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02-hbQIyLlzZ1Bu80E88ueNYp0sqA%3A1615239634917&ei=0plGYMi7N8Sd-gS26o3wBA&q=notion+for+microsoft+power+apps&oq=notion+for+microsfot+power+apps&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgjELADECcyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsAMyBwgAEEcQsANQAFgAYO8qaAJwAXgAgAFZiAGpAZIBATKYAQCqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEJwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjI7KnF1KHvAhXEjp4KHTZ1A04Q4dUDCA4&uact=5" >}}

Only looking at the results here. I see an article...

>How to Connect Microsoft SharePoint and Notion (integration ...

How long until Microsoft builds its content editing solution? Do they only need to integrate MS Docs with One Drive and expose the endpoint with some Sanity like Groq to create a headless content solution?

### Forum Microsfot Powerusers - Entities as the backend

{{< link-preview "https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Building-Power-Apps/Entities-as-the-backend/td-p/113249#" >}}

Just trying to get an idea of how all these things may connect or integrate into my current preferred tech stack.

### Forum Microsfot Powerusers - Building a Custom API for PowerApps using Azure App Service Web Apps

{{< link-preview "https://powerapps.microsoft.com/hi-in/blog/building-a-custom-api-for-powerapps-using-azure-app-service-web-apps/" >}}

> you can simply create a REST API in your favorite platform using any language, describe it using Swagger and use it in PowerApps

There is a whole tutorial here. I plan to circle back.

Looks like there is potential here for me to grow and develop in this space. What is the pricing model? Vendor lock-in?

### Website Microsoft Azure - App Service pricing

{{< link-preview "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/pricing/details/app-service/windows/" >}}

There are free options -> the cheapest basic plan is $0.096/hour. This includes 1 core (? unknown generation and architecture) and 1.75 GB RAM with 10 GB storage.

The cheapest basic plan is $0.096/hour -> up to $840/year. The cheapest standard plan is $0.128/hour -> up to $1120/year.

They also want $90/year for a standard SSL certificate.

I fully intend to build toy apps with the free models before jumping in further. Will also seek out some approved Microsoft training.

### Website Scotch - Creating a Custom API with Strapi - A Node Headless CMS

{{< link-preview "https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-custom-api-with-strapi-a-node-headless-cms" >}}

I am already in the planning for using Strapi for a content web project. I am interested in the ability of Strapi to be used in a greater capacity.

> I would use Strapi as a Headless CMS because it allows for flexibility in content types. We could build a custom app whereas other CMSs are geared towards blogs.

### Blog Netlify - Use a Custom Strapi Back-End to Build a Jamstack App

{{< link-preview "https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/06/24/use-a-custom-strapi-back-end-to-build-a-jamstack-app/" >}}

I have already deployed Strapi to Heroku but I want to be able to test out multiple options.

I have used Netlify a ton and have nothing but amazing things to say!

### Google Search - strapi on render

{{< link-preview "https://www.google.com/search?q=strapi+on+render&oq=strapi+on+render&aqs=chrome..69i57.2022j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" >}}

I have used Render to deploy a few static apps. I intend to revisit the platform. 

I also intend to write an article comparing various deployment strategies for Jamstack websites and Progressive Web Apps.

> Render One-Click Deploy - Strapi

Looks good.

### Article dev.to - GraphQL - What is it and what does it solve? by Julián Scialabba

{{< link-preview "https://dev.to/juliansci/graphql-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-solve-15p1#:~:text=What%20is%20GraphQL%3F,REST%20APIs%20were%20causing%20them.&text=Thus%2C%20they%20started%20to%20create,it%20in%20a%20single%20request." >}}

I only skimmed this article initially. Now that I am writing out this I have revisited and read the entire article.

> with a single query, we will obtain the exact information that we need to avoid underfetching and overfetching data

> GraphQL uses a strong type system it is a documented language by definition

> we can measure performance for each attribute requested and this provides crucial insights about the performance of your API

### Google Search - blogs have threads

Just thinking about the structure of information. Nothing here connects with me.

### Google Search - organize in notion and reorder brain

I use Notion. 

Notion is great for so many things. I need to build my own platform. I do not wish to be at the mercy of another's feature roadmap. I want to own my own content.

I used Hugo to build Jamstack sites years ago. I know this could be a perfect tool for a content-rich blog. Hugo has an excellent built-in taxonomy system that I can take advantage of.

### Website themes.gohugo.io - Hugo Themes

{{< link-preview "https://themes.gohugo.io/" >}}

I want to use an existing theme. I want to reduce the time to publish.

### Documentation stack.jimmycai.com - Getting Started

{{< link-preview "https://docs.stack.jimmycai.com/getting-started" >}}

I chose this theme because of its simplicity, and content the first approach. I will be customizing this theme over the next month. For now, it is good to go, dummy content and all.

## What did I learn?

This was my first blog post here. I while this is documentation of my thread of thought it is not scoped to a specific topic.

I like the idea. This is a cross-thread. Which is a term I am using to describe a line of thought that crosses into multiple domains. 

I do plan on revisiting these topics again and again.

What did I learn? It feels good to close 89 tabs with no more bookmarks. Everything I need will be here, only now it is also available for others to follow along.
